This is a fresh Karma webpack loader whose primary aim is to be test driven and simple
(currently still in development)

Functionality:
* Allow webpack config within Karma (or merge in from outside)
* Source map friendly
* Allows specifying other files to Karma outside of your webpack bundle

Limitations:
* Does not rely on [webpack dev middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) due to lack of tests for that project
